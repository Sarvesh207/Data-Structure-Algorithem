    The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 15 and the difference between the digits is 3. What is the two-digit number?

[A].	69
[B].	78
[C].	96
[D].	Cannot be determined
[E].	None of these
Answer: Option D

Explanation:

Let the ten's digit be x and unit's digit be y.

Then, x + y = 15 and x - y = 3   or   y - x = 3.

Solving x + y = 15   and   x - y = 3, we get: x = 9, y = 6.

Solving x + y = 15   and   y - x = 3, we get: x = 6, y = 9.

So, the number is either 96 or 69.

Hence, the number cannot be determined.

          /* question 6
          If one-third of one-fourth of a number is 15, then what is the three-tenth of that number?
Solution:

Let us assume the number is ‘x’.

So, according to the statement given
1/3 * (1/4 * x) = 15
(1/4 * x) = 15 * 3
x / 4 = 45
x = 45*4
x = 180

So, 3/10 of 180 is 54 i.e. the answer.
